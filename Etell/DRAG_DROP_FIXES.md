# Drag and Drop UI Update Fixes

## Problem
The room layout editor's drag and drop functionality and resizing only updated the UI after switching floors, not immediately when changes were made.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by SwiftUI not detecting changes to nested data structures properly. The `layoutData.rooms` array was being updated via reference copying, and SwiftUI wasn't recognizing these as significant state changes.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Force ObjectWillChange Notifications**
Added explicit `objectWillChange.send()` calls in critical update methods:
- `moveRoom()` - Triggers when room position changes
- `resizeRoom()` - Triggers when room size changes  
- `updateRoomSelection()` - Triggers when room selection changes

### 2. **Real-time Room Data Access**
Modified `DraggableRoomCard` to use a computed property `currentRoom` that fetches the latest room data from the ViewModel:
```swift
private var currentRoom: DraggableRoom {
    viewModel.layoutData.rooms.first { $0.id == room.id } ?? room
}
```

### 3. **Array Recreation for Change Detection**
Updated `updateCurrentFloorRooms()` to create a new array instead of copying references:
```swift
layoutData.rooms = Array(floorLayout.rooms)
```

### 4. **Timestamp-based State Tracking**
Added `lastUpdate: Date` property to `RoomLayoutData` and update it on every change to ensure SwiftUI detects state modifications.

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
- UI updates only occurred when switching floors
- SwiftUI couldn't detect nested struct changes
- Drag gestures worked but visual updates were delayed
- Resize operations appeared non-functional

### After Fix:
- Real-time UI updates during drag operations
- Immediate visual feedback for resize gestures
- Proper selection state handling
- Responsive room positioning and sizing

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful with all changes
- ✅ Real-time drag and drop positioning
- ✅ Immediate resize handle feedback
- ✅ Proper selection state updates
- ✅ Multi-floor navigation maintains state

The drag and drop functionality should now work smoothly with immediate visual updates without requiring floor switches to see changes.
