# Enhanced Room-by-Room Calibration System

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive room-by-room WiFi calibration system implemented for the E-tell app. The system guides users through a step-by-step process to calibrate each room, hallway, and staircase in their home, providing intelligent recommendations for optimal WiFi placement.

## User Flow

### 1. Initial Setup Flow
- **Environment Selection**: House, Apartment, or Office
- **Floor Count**: 1, 2, or 3 floors
- **Hallway Detection**: Yes/No for hallway presence

### 2. Room-by-Room Calibration Process

#### Step 1: Instructions
- Voice prompt: "Go to the room to calibrate"
- Clear instructions displayed on screen
- User moves to desired location
- Taps "Start Calibration" when ready

#### Step 2: Signal Measurement
- Real-time progress indicator (0-100%)
- Voice feedback: "Starting calibration. Please wait."
- Signal strength measurement with live updates
- Visual feedback with color-coded signal strength

#### Step 3: Location Classification
- Modal sheet appears asking: "What type of location is this?"
- Three options with icons and descriptions:
  - **Room**: Living space or specific room
  - **Hallway**: Corridor or passage  
  - **Staircase**: Stairway between floors
- Floor selection (1, 2, or 3)
- Optional custom name input

#### Step 4: Save and Continue
- Location saved to calibrated list
- Voice prompt: "Location saved. Move to the next room you want to calibrate."
- User can either:
  - "Calibrate Next Room" - Continue the process
  - "Finish Calibration" - Complete and view results

### 3. Final Results and Recommendations

#### Calibration Summary
- Total locations analyzed
- Average signal strength score
- Network health assessment
- Visual progress indicators

#### Detailed Location List
- All calibrated rooms with:
  - Name and type (Room/Hallway/Staircase)
  - Floor number
  - Signal strength percentage
  - Individual recommendations
  - Expandable details

#### Router Placement Recommendations
- Optimal router location based on:
  - Central positioning relative to all rooms
  - Signal strength analysis
  - Room importance weighting
- Visual indicators and reasoning

#### WiFi Extender Recommendations
- Identifies weak coverage areas
- Suggests specific extender placements:
  - **Room Extenders**: For bedrooms, offices with poor signal
  - **Hallway Extenders**: Strategic corridor placement
- Priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Reasoning for each recommendation

#### Network Health Score
- Overall network quality rating (0-100)
- Performance indicators:
  - **80-100**: Excellent coverage
  - **60-79**: Good with room for improvement  
  - **0-59**: Needs attention
- Actionable improvement suggestions

## Recommendation Algorithm

### Router Placement Logic
1. **Signal Quality Analysis**: Identify locations with strongest signal
2. **Centrality Scoring**: Calculate geometric center relative to all rooms
3. **Room Type Weighting**: Prioritize main living areas over utility spaces
4. **Multi-floor Considerations**: Account for vertical signal distribution

### Extender Placement Logic
1. **Weak Area Detection**: Identify locations with <50% signal strength
2. **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Find optimal extender positions
3. **Priority Assignment**: Based on room importance and signal deficit
4. **Type Classification**: 
   - Room extenders for specific spaces
   - Hallway extenders for corridor coverage

### Network Health Scoring
- **Base Score**: Average signal strength across all locations
- **Penalties**: -10 points per weak area
- **Bonuses**: +5 points per strong area
- **Range**: 0-100 scale with descriptive categories

## User Experience Enhancements

### Accessibility
- Large, clear text and buttons
- High contrast visual indicators
- Voice guidance for hands-free operation
- Simple, intuitive navigation

### Visual Design
- Color-coded signal strength (Green/Orange/Red)
- Progress indicators for all steps
- Clean, modern interface design
- Contextual icons and imagery

### Error Handling
